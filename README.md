ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Isaac Caparros Salva.

I am a **Full Stack software developer with over 5 years of experience**, and I am based in Barcelona. Currently, I am employed at Wiris, where I am involved in developing digital solutions for Math and Science (check out my work at [@icaparros-at-wiris](https://github.com/icaparros-at-wiris)). In my daily work, I frequently utilize technologies such as TypeScript, Node.js, React.js, and Docker for both professional and personal projects.

I hold a degree in Videogame Production and Development, and I am passionate about contributing my own resources to the Unity community.
