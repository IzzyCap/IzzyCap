ðŸ‘‹ My name is **Isaac Caparros Salva**. 

I'm a Full Stack software developer with more than 4 years of experience. Based in Barcelona.

Currently working at Wiris developing digital solutions for Math and Science (see @icaparros-at-wiris). TypeScript, Node.js, React.js and Docker are some of the many technologies that I use in my day to day with my professional and personal projects.

Graduated in Videogame Production and Development I also love to share my own created resources to the Unity community.
